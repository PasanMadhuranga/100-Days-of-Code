# Calculator

## Introduction
The Calculator script is a Python-based implementation of a simple arithmetic calculator. It performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The script features a user-friendly interface and a unique ASCII art logo for visual appeal.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Continuous Calculations**: Allows continuous calculations using the result of the previous operation.
- **Error Handling**: Includes handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
- **ASCII Art Logo**: Features a unique Python-themed ASCII art logo for enhanced user experience.
- **Clear and Simple Interface**: Provides clear prompts for input and displays results in an understandable format.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Additional file: `art.py` containing the ASCII art logo.

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Place the `art.py` file in the same directory as the Calculator script.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Script**: Execute `main.py` in a Python environment.
2. **Input Numbers**: Enter the first and second numbers as prompted.
3. **Choose Operation**: Select an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as instructed.
4. **View Results**: The script calculates and displays the result.
5. **Continue or Restart**: Choose to continue with the result or start a new calculation.
6. **Error Handling**: The script prompts for re-entry on invalid inputs or handles mathematical errors.

## Example
