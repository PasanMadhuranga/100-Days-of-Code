# Turtle Race

## Introduction
"Turtle Race" is a Python-based simulation game that allows players to bet on the outcome of a race between colored turtles. The game utilizes Python's Turtle graphics library to visually represent the race and provides an interactive betting prompt for the user.

## Features
- **Colorful Turtles**: Six turtles, each with a unique color, race towards the finish line.
- **User Betting**: Before the race begins, the user is prompted to bet on which turtle they believe will win.
- **Randomized Movement**: Each turtle's movement is randomized to simulate a race.
- **Finish Line**: A finish line is drawn on the screen to mark the end of the race.
- **Race Outcome**: The game announces the winner of the race and whether the user's bet was successful.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics Library

## Installation
No additional installation is required apart from Python and its built-in Turtle library.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the script in Python to begin.
2. **Make Your Bet**: A pop-up window will prompt you to enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on.
3. **Watch the Race**: Once the bet is placed, the race starts, and the turtles begin moving towards the finish line.
4. **Race Results**: After a turtle crosses the finish line, the game announces the winning turtle and whether the player won or lost the bet.
