# Hirst Dot Painting

## Introduction
The "Damien Hirst Dot Painting" project is a Python-based script that creates dot paintings inspired by the works of artist Damien Hirst. Using the Turtle graphics library, this program generates patterns of colorful dots. The project includes two methods: the first extracts colors from an image to create a palette, while the second method uses a predefined set of colors.

## Features
- **Color Palette Generation**: (First Method) Extracts a color palette from an image using the `colorgram.py` library.
- **Predefined Color Palette**: (Second Method) Uses a hardcoded list of RGB color values.
- **Turtle Graphics**: Utilizes Python's Turtle library to draw dots on the screen.
- **Customizable Dot Patterns**: Allows users to create dot paintings with varying patterns and sizes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics Library
- (Optional) `colorgram.py` library for the first method.

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. (Optional for the first method) Install `colorgram.py` using `pip install colorgram.py`.

## How to Use
### First Method:
1. Run `main.py` from the first method.
2. The script will use the extracted color palette to create a dot painting.
3. Click on the Turtle graphics window to exit the program.

### Second Method:
1. Run `main.py` from the second method.
2. The script will use the predefined color palette to create a Damien Hirst-style dot painting.
3. Click on the Turtle graphics window to exit the program.

## File Structure
- `main.py` (First Method): Contains the script to create dot paintings using an extracted color palette.
- `main.py` (Second Method): Contains the script to create dot paintings using a predefined color palette.
- (Optional for the first method) `colorgram.py`: A library used to extract color palettes from images.

## Example Use
- For the first method, the script will automatically generate a dot painting based on the extracted color palette from the specified image file.
- For the second method, the script generates a dot painting using a set of hardcoded RGB colors.

## Contributing
Contributions such as adding more features, optimizing the dot pattern generation, or enhancing the user interface are welcome. Please ensure your code is well-documented and tested.
