# Higher or Lower

## Introduction
The "Higher or Lower" game is a Python script that challenges players to guess which of two options has a higher follower count. This game is based on popular social media personalities and entities, making it an engaging and contemporary trivia challenge. Players are presented with two options and must decide which one they think has a higher social media following.

## Features

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Additional files: `art.py` for ASCII art and `Game_data.py` for the dataset.

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Place `art.py` and `Game_data.py` in the same directory as the main script, `Higher_Lower.py`.

## How to Play
1. **Run the Script**: Start the game by running `Higher_Lower.py`.
2. **Make Your Guess**: Choose between 'A' or 'B' based on who you think has more followers.
3. **View Results**: After each guess, see if you were correct and what your current score is.
4. **Continue Playing**: The game continues with new pairs until a wrong guess is made.
