# Number Guessing Game

## Introduction
The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging Python script that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a certain number of attempts. The game offers two difficulty levels, affecting the number of guesses allowed. It's a great way to test one's intuition and guessing skills.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a number between 1 and 100 at the start of each game.
- **Two Difficulty Levels**: Players can choose between 'easy' (10 attempts) and 'hard' (5 attempts).
- **Guess Feedback**: After each guess, the game informs the player if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- **Attempt Tracking**: Keeps track of the number of attempts remaining.
- **Endgame Messages**: Displays a winning message or reveals the number if the player fails to guess correctly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
No specific installation required. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the script in a Python environment.
2. **Choose Difficulty**: Select 'easy' or 'hard' to set the number of guesses.
3. **Make a Guess**: Enter a number between 1 and 100 as your guess.
4. **View Feedback**: The game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. **Repeat Guessing**: Continue guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts.
6. **Game Over**: The game ends either when you guess the number or exhaust all attempts.
