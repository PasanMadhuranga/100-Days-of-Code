# Quizzler App

## Description
The Quizzler App is a trivia quiz game built using Python that fetches questions from an online API. It presents the user with a series of true or false questions and keeps track of their score. The app utilizes the `requests` module to communicate with the Open Trivia Database API to dynamically generate questions for each game session.

## Features

- Presents a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for interaction.
- Tracks the user's score and updates it with each correct answer.
- Displays a green background for correct answers and red for incorrect ones.
- Shows a final score when the user completes the quiz.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the Tkinter and requests modules.
3. Run `main.py` to start a quiz game.
4. Click the true or false buttons to answer each question.
5. Your score will be updated as you go, with visual feedback provided for each answer.
6. At the end of the quiz, your final score will be displayed.
